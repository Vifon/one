=head1 NAME

One - a unified interface for apt, dpkg etc.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<one> B<command> [ I<command_arguments> ... ]

B<one> [ -- ] I<packages_to_install> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    One Tool to manage them all, One Tool to find them,
    One Tool to install them all and in the darkness run them

One provides a unified interface for Debian package manager which is quite
fragmented (I<dpkg>, I<aptitude>, I<apt-get>, I<apt-cache>,
I<apt-file>...). Just one simple extensible tool combining the most frequently
used functions of the mentioned tools. The available functions are fully
customizable - One can even be adjusted to a completely different package
manager.

=head1 GOALS

=over 4

=item * a single central program to run each command (no need to remember when
we should use I<apt-get> instead of I<aptitude>)

=item * simple and flexible configuration

=item * as little overhead as possible - no output parsing etc., just a simple exec

=item * no custom commands by default - uses only the well-tested standard
Debian commands

=item * short commands inspired by the I<equery> tool in Gentoo

=head1 CONFIG

The config file F<~/.onerc> has a very simple syntax:

    name arbitrary_command_to_run
    # comment

For the default "s" option it would be

    s aptitude search

The separator between I<name> and I<arbitrary_command_to_run> can be any
whitespace character.

The existing commands can be overridden but keep in mind there are two special
commands: "--" which is used for the blank command (package install by default)
and "TUI" which is used when One is run without any arguments (interactive
aptitude interface by default).
